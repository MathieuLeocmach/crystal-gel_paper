  abstract = {We review the free-volume theory (FVT) of Lekkerkerker et al. [Europhys.
	Lett. 20 (1992) 559] for the phase behavior of colloids in the presence
	of non-adsorbing polymer and we extend this theory in several aspects:
	(i) We take the solvent into account as a separate component and
	show that the natural thermodynamic parameter for the polymer properties
	is the insertion work Pi(v), where Pi is the osmotic pressure of
	the (external) polymer solution and v the volume of a colloid particle.
	(ii) Curvature effects are included along the lines of Aarts et al.
	[J. Phys.: Condens. Matt. 14 (2002) 7551] but we find accurate simple
	power laws which simplify the mathematical procedure considerably.
	(iii) We find analytical forms for the first, second, and third derivatives
	of the grand potential, needed for the calculation of the colloid
	chemical potential, the pressure, gas-liquid critical points and
	the critical endpoint (cep), where the (stable) critical line ends
	and then coincides with the triple point. This cep determines the
	boundary condition for a stable liquid. We first apply these modifications
	to the so-called colloid limit, where the size ratio q(R)=R/a between
	the radius of gyration R of the polymer and the particle radius a
	is small. In this limit the binodal polymer concentrations are below
	overlap: the depletion thickness delta is nearly equal to R, and
	Pi can be approximated by the ideal (van't Hoff) law Pi=Pi(0)=phi/N,
	where phi is the polymer volume fraction and N the number of segments
	per chain. The results are close to those of the original Lekkerkerker
	theory. However, our analysis enables very simple analytical expressions
	for the polymer and colloid concentrations in the critical and triple
	points and along the binodals as a function of q(R). Also the position
	of the cep is found analytically. In order to make the model applicable
	to higher size ratio's q(R) (including the so-called protein limit
	where q(R)>1) further extensions are needed. We introduce the size
	ratio q=delta/a, where the depletion thickness delta is no longer
	of order R. In the protein limit the binodal concentrations are above
	overlap. In such semidilute solutions delta approximately xi, where
	the De Gennes blob size (correlation length) xi scales as xi approximately
	phi(-gamma), with gamma=0.77 for good solvents and gamma=1 for a
	theta solvent. In this limit Pi=Pi(sd) approximately phi(3gamma).
	We now apply the following additional modifications: With these latter
	two modifications we obtain again a fully analytical model with simple
	equations for critical and triple points as a function of q(R). In
	the protein limit the binodal polymer concentrations scale as q(R)(1/gamma),
	and phase diagrams phiq(R)(-1/gamma) versus the colloid concentration
	eta become universal (i.e., independent of the size ratio q(R)).
	The predictions of this generalized free-volume theory (GFVT) are
	in excellent agreement with experiment and with computer simulations,
	not only for the colloid limit but also for the protein limit (and
	the crossover between these limits). The q(R)(1/gamma) scaling is
	accurately reproduced by both simulations and other theoretical models.
	The liquid window is the region between phi(c) (critical point) and
	phi(t) (triple point). In terms of the ratio phi(t)/phi(c) the liquid
	window extends from 1 in the cep (here phi(t)-phi(c)=0) to 2.2 in
	the protein limit. Hence, the liquid window is narrow: it covers
	at most a factor 2.2 in (external) polymer concentration.},

@article{Liu2006a,
abstract = {The hard sphere system plays a basic role in condensed matter physics and related fields, and equation of state (EoS) is the ultimate solution to its thermodynamic properties (1-3). Dozens of EoSs have been proposed since van der Waals historic work and many reliable EoSs are available for the stable fluid region (3). For the metstable region, all available EoSs are not accurate enough for various applications. It has been considered impossible to develop an analytical EoS for the entire stable and metstable region 4. By virtue of a potential energy landscape analysis combined with the Woodcock type EoS (2,5), here we show that a fairly simple analytical equation can be obtained to reproduce the compressibility of the entire region with high accuracy. Therefore, all four amorphous states of matter, gas, liquid, supercooled liquid and glass, can be represented with a single EoS. Examples are given to show that highly accurate EoS is necessary for applications in thermodynamic property or liquid structure predictions. By using conventional approaches, such as appending an attractive term of van der Waals type (6) or using the equation within the framework of perturbation theory (1,7), it can be extended to an EoS for various real systems, including supercooled liquids and glasses.},

	be 'tuned' independently by altering the polymer's molecular weight
	and concentration respectively. Over the past decade, one particularly
	simple experimental realization of such a mixture has been studied
	in considerable detail: nearly-hard-sphere particles of poly(methyl
	methacrylate) and random-coil polystyrene dispersed in simple hydrocarbon
	solvents (mainly cis-decalin). The simplicity of the system has enabled
	rather detailed comparison of experimental findings with theory and
	simulation. Here I review the current understanding of the equilibrium
	phase behaviour, structure, phase transition kinetics, and metastability
	of this Model colloid-polymer mixture. These findings form a useful
	reference point for understanding more complex mixtures. Moreover,
	in some cases, insights gained from studying this model system have
	relevance beyond soft-condensed-matter physics, e.g. in understanding
	the liquid state, in controlling protein crystallization, and in
	elucidating the nature of glasses.},

	can be applied to arbitrary colloidal interactions, here we demonstrate
	its efficacy with two well-known systems for which accurate theories
	are available: a colloid-polymer mixture and binary hard spheres.
	The high sensitivity of this method allows for the precise determination
	of complex interactions, as exemplified, for example, by the accurate
	resolution of the oscillatory effective potential of the binary hard
	sphere system. We argue that the method is particularly well suited
	for the determination of attractive forces.},
