{\bf Supplementary Movies}

\emph{Supplementary Movie 1}. This movie shows the early stage of gelation process of $\phi\approx 0.30$ and $c_p=0.38$ mg/g, from the original confocal images at the same z-position as Fig.~3a. Total duration is 1160 s (~530~$\tau$). We quickly started scanning the sample after exchanging the salt-reservoir with the solvent including salt. At the beginning, salt had not reached the scanning volume and colloids were dispersed by electrostatic repulsion. At 0:02 in the movie, salt diffused into the scanning volume and screened the surface charges of colloids. Then, colloids immediately initiated phase separation by short-ranged attractions.



\emph{Supplementary Movie 2}.
This movie shows the late stage after Supplemental Movie 1 with scanning duration of 27000~s (~12300$\tau$).
